/// This xcconfig is used to make Xcode build all of its artefacts to a
/// custom folder. Use it for command line builds so that their caches
/// do not interfere with the caches of normal builds from inside Xcode.

/// To make most sense of the following configuration you should also redirect
/// path to derived data using xcodebuild parameter:
/// xcodebuild ...-derivedDataPath $(DERIVED_DATA_DIR)...
/// where $(DERIVED_DATA_DIR) also points to Build-command-line/DerivedData

/// Tested against Xcode 7.3.1 (7D1014)
